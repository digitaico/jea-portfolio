# POSE ESTIMATION OF HUMAN BODIES

Pose Estimation is a branch of computer vision with a wide field of applications, from assessing humans in image detection to 
helping athletes improve their movement and workers to improve ergonomics.

This repo contains an app developed to analyze runners movements, generating domain specific metrics like step length, center 
of gravity, symmetry and time of flight among others.

It uses `OpenCV` to capture read and write video frames. Also uses `MediaPipe` DNN a trained model for Pose Estimation.  

Finally I estimate some metrics to help us, runners to improve speed and reduce injuries.
