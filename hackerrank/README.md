# HACKERRANK

This repo contains problems solved in python and ES6.  

It exists because I need to prepare for coding assessments.
It will be populated by stages, meaning a problem solved, a problem committed.



Its structure is:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Data Structures

I'll tackle common coding challenges like:
- Search
- Sort
- Dynamic Programming
